Text: Recruitment in the blue collar sector relies on a network of middle-men who influence the hiring process and prey on the financial desperation of workers. Skill & expectation mismatch between employers and job seekers also lead to greater conflict and attrition.

Quote: I had decided to resign from my previous job in Dubai due to some offensive comments made by a co-worker. Now, after resigning, my employment visa got cancelled and I only had 30 days to find employment or go back to my home country (Kenya). I went from office to office dropping off my CVs, but to no avail. The offers I was given were below my previous salary and not in line with my skills or experience. I then came across ZoEasy's platform, and got in touch with their team to seek assistance. This was a great choice, especially when I was in distress. ZoEasy worked with me on my CV, reviewed my experience, helped me understand and highlight my strengths, and matched me to a top employer in the hospitality space. I'm now earning AED 1000 more than I used to, and enjoy the working culture and environment.
