Quote: "Participating in the upcycling project opened me up to a world of ideas and creativity. I was able to use, reuse, repurpose, and manage waste effectively. I learnt that not all trash is dump and it was more economical to use that getting new things. In the words of David Okpatuma, I now 'think twice before I buy once'. "  Mary Mumuni Jos, Nigeria
