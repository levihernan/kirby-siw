Text2: The Partnership Elevation project (PEP) is going to redefine the history of politics in Africa ! It is going to remove the image of violence associated with political participation and create new modern political opportunities. PEP’s App will educate and give youth and women across Africa a new and greater role in African politics. The App emerges at a perfect time given that Africa recorded the highest growth in internet use globally going from 2% in 2005 to over 24% in 2018. Now, it’s digital participation that defines politics in Africa, not violence ! Be part of the revolution! (“Tools, not rules to define your arch”).
