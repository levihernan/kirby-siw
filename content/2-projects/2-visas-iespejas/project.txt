Quote: I was organising a small youth event in our small 3000 people city, when suddenly my phone rings, and the lady on the other side of the phone asks: "I found your event on Visas Iespejas, can six of us join it?" Due to the Visas Iespejas platform the event doubled in size and we met new people from the other side of the region that we previously did not know anything about. (Simona Putniņa, youth coordinator in Saulkrasti municipality)

We want to allow every young person independent of their location to utilise their potential by participating both in local as well as global opportunities.
