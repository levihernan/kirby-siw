Quote: The Sexplain staff have a real knack in keeping sessions fun and lighthearted, yet delivering all the facts, across the plethora of RSE topics, and keeping all the students fully engaged. Key messages of consent, respect, safety and assertiveness were paramount, and students felt confident to ask a vast range of questions that they simply wouldn’t ask a teacher. Absolutely brilliant and highly professional – I am SO pleased to have found Sexplain! (Annabel Taylor-Ross, Head of PSHE, Blundell's School)
