Title: Partnership Elevation Project (PEP)

----

Text: The PEP is bringing in every citizenâ€™s phone a new, modern and steady way to connect politically with your fellow citizens and to speak directly to their government! The government too will have a direct way to engage with you via the App on the solutions it gives to your problems. Political participation is a year-long process and partnership between citizen and government. And the PEP is going to bridge the gap !

##Young innovator: Veronica Almedom
A transition to digitalization is happening. The way Africans live is drastically changing. And the way they engage politically is inevitably going to metamorphose policy-making on the continent. So do African leaders want to adopt a visionary approach by anticipating the changes and adapt to this new era? We hope you will!
