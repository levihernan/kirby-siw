There are currently more than 65 million refugees in the world and more than 50% of them are young people and children who have been forcibly displaced and have no hope for a better future for themselves because of zero representation. The team formed will each focus on a region and our goal is to be able to build national youth advisory councils within Asia, Africa and the Americas and in the future have local advisory councils who will work with NGOs & INGOs on the betterment of the treatment of refugees.
The GYAC is currently being represented during all global consultations and we have also been the catalyst of youth voices in the Global Compact for Refugees with UNHCR.
