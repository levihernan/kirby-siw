Chad now has more than 15,600,000 inhabitants and is experiencing rapid population growth. Nearly 46% of the population is of working age, ie an unemployment rate of 22%, which mainly affects the age group between 15 and 30 years, which constitutes 60% of the population. A rate that does not reflect the reality of the job market. From a global point of view, apart from young graduates, there is an ambivalent situation of widespread underemployment.

Unemployed youth with few prospects and little hope for their future could be a danger to themselves and to society. Other social and human consequences are also noted. It is mainly a feeling of worthlessness, a lack of self-confidence, a breakdown of family relationships and a deterioration of social relations.

In view of this situation, who other than the youth itself can solve it? The Youth Network for Development and Leadership therefore wants to provide young Chadians with a framework and opportunities for development that will enable them to create positive change, in several strategic directions, within their communities through the culture of leadership. and Promoting entrepreneurship in young people by providing a collaborative workspace and accessible special programs. The initiative of this project demonstrates the commitment of the Chadian youth to face the challenges and to improve the dailies of the Chadian people and the inhabitants of the world by innovative ideas. Through the RJDLT, the opportunity is given to the youth to improve the future and to shape their own destiny.
The Network, through active leadership, aims to promote the culture of entrepreneurship, peace, people's security, environmental protection and good governance, to bring together entrepreneurial and promising youth, bringing innovative solutions to evils of the Chadian society.
