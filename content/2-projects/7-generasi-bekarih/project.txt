Quote: Joining Leaders Foundation Camp, organised by Generasi Bekarih have made me realised a lot of things. They showed me, the importance of family and their blessings especially parents in daily lives. Thanks to them, I am able to appreciate my family more than I was before. To have lifetime goals help myself in achieving the dreams that I've always wanted. Alhamdulillah, after the camps, I'm given the trust to be Youth Leader in a Non-government Organisation of Masjid Kampong Perpindahan Mata-mata. Through this camps, I have also developed skills, such as, Public Speaking and People's Skill. Generasi Bekarih also helped me to polish my Leadership Skills. Thus, with the constant improvement, Generasi Bekarih sees right through my potential and as of February 2019, they welcome me as the Junior Project Manager. With their guidance, I have done 5 projects and more to come because from them, I realised that giving back to Brunei, the youth and its society is invaluable.
