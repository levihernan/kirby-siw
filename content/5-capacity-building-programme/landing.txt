Title: Capacity Building Programme

----

Text: The Capacity Building Program is a 5-week, online, learn-by-doing training for young innovators to explore the multiple dimensions to be considered when delivering social innovation projects with a strong focus on impact.

----

Text2: 

Young innovators already have knowledge and skills they can share to inspire fellow leaders. Rather that imposing content, the learning experience has been designed to stimulate participants to engage with the topics they consider relevant for their own context and encourage them to guide their peers on topics they already have experience in. Depending on their Learning Journey, young innovators may go through all or just some of the topics.

We aim for young innovators to: 
- Develop a better understanding of the different elements of impact assessment
- Understand the options, risks and opportunities of scaling up
- Understand the multiple factors involved in a economically sustainable project, even if the project is not considered a social enterprise. 
- Develop skills and connections that can help them accomplish their goals.
